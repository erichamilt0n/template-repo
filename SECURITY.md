4. **Fix and Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.

## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

1. **Automated Security Scanning**
   - Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning
   - CodeQL for code analysis
   - Regular dependency updates via Dependabot

2. **Code Review Process**
   - All changes require review
   - Security-critical changes require additional review
   - Automated CI/CD checks

3. **Development Practices**
   - Secure coding guidelines
   - Regular security training for maintainers
   - Third-party security audits

## Security-Related Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive data
   - Use `.env` files (listed in `.gitignore`)
   - Document required environment variables

2. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Authentication requirements

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask you to:
